To fix Ronix’s inefficient re-injection system, right-click your taskbar and open Task Manager. Close any “injector.exe” processes. If none appear, close Ronix and they should show up. Then, launch Roblox, join a game, and inject Ronix. Press F9 in Roblox to confirm injection. You’ll need to close injector.exe every time you leave or join a game, or you can open it manually from the "bin" folder in the "Ronix" folder. Use the standard Roblox process for better injection.

Avoid bypassing to prevent outdated downloads. After downloading, extract the bootstrapper from the zip file and place it in a dedicated folder. Run it as an administrator to fix any "system32/Ronix" errors. Never run the bootstrapper directly from the zip file. Also, disable antivirus real-time protection or create an exception for a smoother experience.
